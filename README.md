# Hata_Model_Path_Loss_Calculator
This repository is a MATLAB-based path loss calculator that uses the Hata propagation model to estimate radio signal attenuation in urban environments. It allows users to input carrier frequency, transmitter height, and receiver height, then generates a distance vs. path loss plot for distances
